# archival
A list of things I've archived, am archiving, or plan to archive.

I currently don't have proper backups for ~~a lot of~~ all of this stuff. I'm working on it.

| name | description | status | notes |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ----- |
| reddit_embeds | an unordered list of every media URL on a few specific subreddits | active | not a high priority; may miss a few links. |
| scp_wiki | an archive of the SCP Wiki in LaTeX | hiatus | most pages before mid-to-late 2020 are accounted for; only the latest revision is stored, and due to technical issues new data isn't being collected |
| defcon | an archive of all U.S. DEF CON conference notes and videos | active | almost complete. updated manually |
| super_humman | an archive of super humman's YouTube channel, for "historical relevance." | hiatus | >50% of videos at archival time were collected; new videos are not being added. |
| schematics | an archive of a bunch of schematics | planned | awaiting categorization |
| solar_sect | several dozen gigabytes of "Solar Sect of Mystic Wisdom" remixes, apparently... | planned | N/A |
| derp | an archive of several gigabytes of pseudoscience PDFs by a guy who goes by "Derp"... | complete | N/A |
| radium | The Radium incident. We don't talk about it. Not for public consumption (both ways). | complete | N/A |
| hololive | archive of various HoloLive streamers. | hiatus | other people already have archives of almost everything, apparently |
