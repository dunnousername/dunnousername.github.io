I'm committed to providing an accurate, unbiased viewpoint on every article.
If you have a suggestion, constructive criticism, or just useful feedback in general, you can file an issue [here](https://github.com/dunnousername/dunnousername.github.io/issues) and I'll try my best to get back to you about it.
If I end up changing an article, I'll mention you by username or anonymously (your choice) in the article, with an (appropriate, non-political) message of your choosing (if you would like).

If you would like to talk to me privately about something, additional contact info can be found below.
