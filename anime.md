Congratulations. This page isn't properly indexed, so you're either extremely lucky to find it or decently clever.

(a lot of the plots are dumbed down a bit, don't @ me.)

# Animes I've watched, in chronological order.
## Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid (S1E1-S1E7, 7 episodes)
This is the first anime I've ever watched.
I watched up to and partway through the first fanservice episode (S1E7), but didn't really care for it much.
It's good, but I find myself more interested in other animes now.
Essentially, this series follows the life of a dragon with human features that intends to fulfill the wishes of Miss Kobayashi as a maid.

## Attack on Titan (S1E1-S2E30, 30 episodes)
This is the second anime I've watched.
It's extremely different from the first anime I've watched in every way.

In the AoT universe, humanity lives within enormous walls to hide from giant man-eating humanoids called Titans.
The story takes place in medieval times, and this makes it extremely difficult to fight Titans.
Titans also regenerate most of their limbs and other body parts, so for the most part Titans must be avoided since they can almost not be killed.
When a collosal Titan breaches one of the walls humanity resides in, chaos and disarray ensues, and humanity is at risk of extinction.

I really enjoyed this anime, but not everyone else does. A lot of people seem to either love it or think it is terrible. It takes itself very seriously, which I really enjoy, and I think there is a deep underlying message within it, but there is probably someone who would argue otherwise.

## Ghost Stories (English Dub) (S1E1-S1E5, 5 episodes)
A lot of people are really passionate about hating on dubbed anime, but there's a reason I chose the dubbed version.
From what I've heard, the rights to the English dub were sold off to voice actors with no actual script.
So, the voice actors made up an entirely new script.

The new script is often humourous and doesn't make sense, and was definitely made tongue-in-cheek.
I enjoyed it because of the humour of the English dub, but I'm sure the actual plot is a good one too.
Overall, pretty good.

## GATE (S1E1, 1 episode)
Someone recommended me GATE since they said it's similar to AoT.
Honestly, I didn't find it that interesting, but I don't think I really went far enough into it to give it a proper rating, so I'll leave it at that.

## Konosuba (S1E1-S1E11, 11 episodes)
I enjoy Konosuba more than every other anime mentioned above.
~~It's like Old School Runescape but the thief skill is even better.~~
Essentially, the plot follows the adventures of a shut-in who died under embarrasing circumstances.
In the afterlife, he chooses not to go to heaven but to be reincarnated in a magical fantasy world.

There's a lot of stuff in the anime that is... "suggestive," at the very least.
I wouldn't watch it with my parents, but it's not problematic enough to make me stop watching it or anything.

The main character is powerful and unafraid to command his allies to do fanservicey stuff, and his allies are dumb enough that they rely on him for survival, and will do anything to get something out of him.

For example, one of his allies is a female goddess, and when she is in frame the camera is often located behind her, and above her if she is lying down or below her if she is standing or kneeling.

Overall, I enjoy the dynamics between the characters, and some of the characters act in mysterious ways, which often ends humourously (I'm looking at you, Darkness).
