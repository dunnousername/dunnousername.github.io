## Welcome to my site!

I'm dunnousername. Hello!

I do many interesting things. At least, *I* believe they are interesting. Currently, most of my projects are in data science and machine learning.
You can find my list of projects [here](projects.md). I also have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/dunnousername) where a lot of the code I write is stored.

One of my goals is to get the power of machine learning into the hands of as many people as possible. It's really neat, after all!
That is why I wrote [first-order-wrapper](first-order-wrapper.md). Most people know about me from that project, since it's (as of the time of this writing) the most popular project I've ever written, with over 600 stars and 100 forks! However, I do lots of other interesting stuff, so make sure to check out my other projects!
