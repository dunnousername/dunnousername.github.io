## Welcome to my site!

I'm Henry, a tinkerer, neural network enthusiast, and future data scientist. Hello!

My real name is Henry, but many of my projects are tied to the alias "dunnousername." This alias is tied to my open source projects and for technical reasons (broken links are bad) I likely won't be (and can't be) changing it. As of the time of this writing (9/22/2020), I'm a high school senior living on the east coast of the United States. **If you're looking for my resume, it can be found [here](resume.md).**

I do many interesting things. Currently, most of my projects are in data science and machine learning, and those are also the fields I intend to major in. I'm really passionate about these things, and I want other people to enjoy them as well! I wrote a few projects intended to get people interested in ML, and this blog serves as a more in-depth resource on what I'm up to these days, some of those projects included.

You can find my list of noteworthy projects [here](projects.md). I also have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/dunnousername) where a lot of the code I write is stored. I'm almost always doing something interesting, so make sure to check out my projects!
