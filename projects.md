## My projects!

My most well-known project is [first-order-wrapper](first-order-wrapper.md).

Here are some other projects I'm working on:
- [SpiderGAN](spidergan.md) (work in progress; real and fake spider images are spoilered)

Additionally, here are some other projects I'm working on that aren't strictly related to machine learning or data science:
- [m3u8a2](m3u8a2/m3u8a2.md) (download M3U8/HLS playlists in parallel with aria2c)
