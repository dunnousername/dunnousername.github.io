## My projects!

My most well-known project is [first-order-wrapper](first-order-wrapper.md).
In my opinion, the projects listed below are more interesting, but at the time of this writing, it is still the most popular project I've done.

Here are some other projects I'm working on, with the best ones at the top:
- ~~[Fitting "Bad Apple!!" losslessly compressed on a 1.44M floppy disk](bad_apple/bad_apple.md)~~ (coming soon!)
- [Analyzing Backblaze Hard Drive Reliability Data](backblaze_drive_stats/backblaze_drive_stats.md) (work in progress!)
- [SpiderGAN](spidergan.md) (part 1 is done; real and fake spider images are spoilered)

Additionally, here are some other projects I'm working on that aren't strictly related to machine learning or data science:
- [m3u8a2](m3u8a2/m3u8a2.md) (download M3U8/HLS playlists in parallel with aria2c)

Lastly, I write a few even less scientific articles. Usually I do this if they wouldn't fit well in a more organized format, but I wanted to talk about them anyway.
- [R00000 - $10 InfiniBand cards?](random/r00000.md)
