## R00000 - Cheap Infiniband cards?

The year is 2011. Intel releases [a socket of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA_2011), 
[a car with a robotic eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_(rover)) will begin its journey to the surface of another world, and 
Nintendo releases [a version of the DS that gives people a headache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS).

More importantly, though, FDR InfiniBand switches and adapters are announced, featuring roughly 40 *gigabits* of bandwidth over a single QSFP connector. I couldn't find any price data on it at launch, but dual-QSFP adapters [can still be purchased new](https://store.mellanox.com/products/nvidia-mellanox-mcx354a-fcct-connectx-3-pro-vpi-adapter-card-dual-port-qsfp-fdr-ib-and-40-56gbe-pcie3-0-x8-8gt-s-rohs-r6.html) for $639.00 from Mellanox's website.

Of course, nowadays you can also buy a [dual-200 gigabit infiniband card new](https://store.mellanox.com/products/nvidia-mellanox-mcx653106a-ecat-sp-single-pack-connectx-6-vpi-adapter-card-hdr100-edr-ib-and-100gbe-dual-port-qsfp56-pcie3-0-4-0-x16-tall-bracket.html) for under $2k from the same website. For applications where bandwidth and latency are just as important as raw compute power - such as in supercomputers, where InfiniBand is extremely common - upgrading makes a lot of sense.

So much sense, in fact, that 100 [used 40-gigabit dual-QSFP cards](https://www.ebay.com/itm/764737-001-HP-INFINIBAND-FDR-ETHERNET-10GB-40GB-2-PORT-544-FLR-QSFP/283724438479?epid=1951027147&hash=item420f4b5bcf:g:R7kAAOSwDIJeBjSW) can be had for less than the price of [this extremely scientific jar of peanut butter](https://www-s.nist.gov/srmors/view_detail.cfm?srm=2387).
As a more sane comparison, one of those used 40-gigabit dual-QSFP cards costs *less* than this [new Gigabit Ethernet consumer card](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-1000Mbps-Gigabit-Ethernet-supported/dp/B003CFATNI/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=ethernet+card&qid=1602091824&sr=8-3).

### So what's the catch?

For one, they probably aren't as "plug-and-play" as a standard Ethernet card, and there's no guarantee that the drivers provided (if any) back in 2011 still work now. 
You may get lucky with open source drivers on Linux, but I don't have a card to test that with.
Additionally, these aren't normal network cards. You can run TCP/IP over them, but they're moreso intended for allowing a network device to directly write or read (DMA) to the host's memory without the CPU, which, while fascinating, means TCP/IP is a relatively odd use case for them.
Also, the cables are expensive - often even more expensive than the cards themselves. They also can't run very far compared to Ethernet cables.

Still, I think these InfiniBand cards have a lot of potential. As for what potential specifically, I'm not entirely sure, but I'm interested to see what people do with these. It's literally supercomputer hardware!
