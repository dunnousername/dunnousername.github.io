      <description>tokamak wasn&amp;rsquo;t a new build. It comes from an older system, one with sentimental value, and it inherits this.
From the ashes rise a new server Pretty much only the motherboard was the same. It was a socket LGA 1155, and I upgraded from a Celeron G1620 to a Xeon E3-1220 V2, which isn&amp;rsquo;t even supported on this entry-level motherboard, but somehow worked after adding a discrete GPU in the x1 slot.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had many computers.
Some are still here. They&amp;rsquo;re powered on, or they&amp;rsquo;re in a closet waiting to be looked at again. Others are lost, many are forgotten, and too many are left behind.
There are several computers that I keep around, either out of utility or for their history.
Two in particularly come to mind - tokamak, and toshiba.
This is the story of tokamak.
The beginning tokamak was the first computer and the last computer I&amp;rsquo;ve ever built, in a way, even though I&amp;rsquo;ve built several.</description>
