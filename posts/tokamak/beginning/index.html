    <p>I&rsquo;ve had many computers.</p>
<p>Some are still here. They&rsquo;re powered on, or they&rsquo;re in a closet waiting to be looked at again. Others are lost, many are forgotten, and too many are left behind.</p>
<p>There are several computers that I keep around, either out of utility or for their history.</p>
<p>Two in particularly come to mind - tokamak, and toshiba.</p>
<p>This is the story of tokamak.</p>
<h2 id="the-beginning">The beginning</h2>
<p>tokamak was the first computer and the last computer I&rsquo;ve ever built, in a way, even though I&rsquo;ve built several. tokamak actually stems from the first computer I&rsquo;ve ever built, which didn&rsquo;t have a name. I remember having an Ubuntu install with the hostname <code>FusionReactor</code>, which is where the name <code>tokamak</code> comes from, but I&rsquo;m not entirely sure whether <code>FusionReactor</code> was the original system or another computer.</p>
<p>I built my first computer, which we&rsquo;ll assume was in fact <code>FusionReactor</code>, when I was 13 or so. It had a bunch of poor design choices, but I eventually completed the entire thing after some help from a local computer shop called CDW. At the time it was one of the most important experiences I ever had.</p>
<p>And for that reason it held a very special place in my heart.</p>
<p>In terms of technical specifications, it was pretty awful.
It had a Celeron G1620 for a CPU, which I cannot recommend anyone buy.
Don&rsquo;t buy a Celeron when you could get a Pentium for an extra $5-10.</p>
<p>Anyway, I grew out of this computer, later using an FX-6300 system, and then a Ryzen 5 2600 system. <code>FusionReactor</code> was collecting dust. At the same time, I was looking at building my first RAID array. <a href="/posts/tokamak/phoenix/">These paths ended up colliding.</a></p>
