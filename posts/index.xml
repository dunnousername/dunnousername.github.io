      <description>You might&amp;rsquo;ve heard about &amp;ldquo;containerization,&amp;rdquo; or about Docker, or Kubernetes, or various other pieces of software.
It&amp;rsquo;s a really neat technology, but it&amp;rsquo;s also become somewhat of a buzzword. As someone who uses containers on a regular basis, I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that everyone can benefit from containers. However, I believe everyone can benefit from knowing what containers are.

Technical This site is yet another iteration of my personal blog.
It&amp;rsquo;s currently based on the base16 hugo theme. There will likely be more details on the hardware and software in the future, but for now, this is a simple test page only.</description>
