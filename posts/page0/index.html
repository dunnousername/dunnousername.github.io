<h2 id="page0">page0</h2>
<p>page0 is the first page.
I guess that technically means there are negative pages, but those aren&rsquo;t up on this site (yet?).</p>
<h3 id="technical">Technical</h3>
<p>This site is yet another iteration of my personal blog.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s currently based on the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/base16/">base16</a> <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> theme.
There will likely be more details on the hardware and software in the future, but for now, this is a simple test page only.</p>
<h3 id="the-shortened-history-of-page0-before-i-forget">The shortened history of page0, before I forget</h3>
<p>My original blog used Jekyll on GitHub pages.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like the themes it had and I found it hard to work with in some weird use cases.</p>
<p>Also it was written on Ruby, and I didn&rsquo;t want the work of installing another programming language I don&rsquo;t know how to use on my server if I were to host it in the future.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few months, and <code>tokamak</code> (blog post in the future?) is my new server.
Then I get bored and write a few hundred lines of code, write my own CMS using Markdown and Jinja2 on top of Flask and Gunicorn, and go
on a wild containerization spree.</p>
<p>Then I start getting back into running <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/ArchiveTeam_Warrior">Archive Team Warriors</a> (and you should too).
I had a competition with one of my friends to try and get higher on the leaderboards.
The leaderboards have a &ldquo;stream view&rdquo; that shows items as they are uploaded to the servers.
The idea is that this encourages people to run more instances because their name shows up more often.</p>
<p>Anyway, I found a nickname like <a href="https://www.vegard.net/"><code>wwwvegardnet</code></a> on the boards, and I decided to go that site.
They had a really nice site, and after reading through some of the articles, I found that they used Hugo as a CMS.</p>
<p>At this point I had never heard of Hugo, but I looked at it and decided to replace <code>dynsrv</code>&rsquo;s (blog post soon?) <code>/pages/render</code> endpoint with Hugo.</p>
<p>And here we are.</p>
