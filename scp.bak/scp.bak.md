## Introduction
The [SCP Wiki](http://www.scpwiki.com/) is an online collaborative fiction project which has become widely known through one way or another in various parts of internet culture. The SCP Wiki describes themselves like this in the [FAQ](http://www.scpwiki.com/faq):

> Q: In-character, what is the SCP Foundation?
>
> A: We are the last bastion of security in a world where natural laws rapidly break down. We are here to protect humanity from the things that go bump in the night, from people who wield power beyond mortal understanding. We are here to make the world a safer place. We are the holders of wonders, and the caretakers of dreams. We are why the world continues.

The project was started in 2008 (although the first article was written in 2007, it wasn't on a wiki site), and moved to a site called Wikidot in the middle of that year. 
In recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that Wikidot may spontaneously stop working some day. Here's an excerpt from the [Archive Team page for Wikidot](https://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Wikidot):

> Wikidot is a social networking service and wiki hosting service (or wiki farm) operated and owned by Wikidot Inc., founded by Michal Frackowiak. It's the world's third-largest wiki farm with over 1 million active users, hosting over 12 million pages. Wikidot serves both private and public sites. 
> ...
> As of late 2019 the site feels moribund. All development ceased years ago, no marketing posts are being made and the support forum has no official representation, just one unofficial volunteer. Complaints about unresponsive management, even for paid accounts, are frequent and unaddressed.
> ...
> Search stopped indexing new content mid Dec 2019 and the anti-spam bots aren't running. The site was put up for sale in a BitCoin forum in February 2020.

Archive Team also lists the "Archiving status" as "Not saved yet."

There seems to be both public and private archives for the SCP Wiki specifically, but the only public backup I found was last updated in August 2020, and since the private backups are private there is no way to confirm that they are up to date either.

Additionally, the only project capable of rendering Wikidot syntax appears to be the Wikidot project itself. While some of the code is open source, it probably is poorly maintained and hasn't been updated in a while. I decided I wanted to, in addition to backing up the SCP Wiki, convert it to a format like LaTeX so that it can be rendered without Wikidot's code.
