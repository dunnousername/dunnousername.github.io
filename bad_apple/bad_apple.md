# Fitting "Bad Apple!!" losslessly on a 1.44MB floppy disk
## Introduction
### "Bad Apple!!"?
For the uninitiated, ["Bad Apple!!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lNZ_Rnr7Jc) refers to a background music track from one of the *Touhou Project* games, as well as a separate monochrome animation made by a fan.
*Touhou Project* consists of several video games made by a one-man development team continuously from 1997 all the way to the current day. They are a huge part of Japanese culture, both inside and outside of Japan, and there are a huge number of fan-made works in the Touhou universe as well.
One of these fan-made works is the video linked above, which became a staple of Japanese internet culture.
The "Bad Apple!!" video consists of black-and-white frames that illustrate the lore of *Touhou Project*, which synchronize with the background music track of the same name.

Because the animation consists only of two colors, it is widely used as a test vector that can be displayed on low-end hardware, only requiring a 1-bit display and the hardware (and software) to render the animation itself.
People have managed to run it on anything, from [8-bit AVR microcontrollers](https://hackaday.com/2019/01/08/bad-apple-via-the-arduino-mega/) to [TI-84+ SE graphing calculators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eq5T9dE58E4) to [the Windows Task Manager CPU usage screen](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/hbx72t/if_this_is_not_the_correct_way_to_use_a_64core/), and even [original IBM PC's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdG413nNkI&feature=emb_logo) (which I found out about after finishing most of this project; however, he compresses it lossily, while I compress it losslessly).

I wanted to do the same, but fit the whole thing on a 1.44MB floppy disk, and without compressing the animation in any way which visually distorts it. And I did!
